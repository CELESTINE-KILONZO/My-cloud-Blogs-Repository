ðŸŒŸ i am excited to Share Insights from Besa Program session 5: Building and Training Machine Learning Model.ðŸŒŸ

In our latest Besa program sessions, we delved deep into the crucial realm of basics of Machine Learning and AI , and What an enlightening experience it has been! ðŸ’¡

# Steps in Building a Machine Learning Model

1.Prepare

2.Build

3.Train

4.Deploy

# Amazon SageMaker Ecosystem

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service that helps users prepare data,build,train and deploy ML models.

### Difference between Amazon SageMaker Canvas and Amazon SageMaker Studio

1.Amazon SageMaker Canvas offers a no-code, graphical interface, allowing users to build machine learning models without writing any code while Amazon SageMaker Studio is Code-driven IDE

2.Amazon SageMaker Canvas can be used by non-technical users while Amazon SageMaker Studio can only be used by experienced people in tech such as developers.

3.Amazon SageMaker automatically selects algorithms and parameters while Amazon SageMaker Studio one has full control over algorithm choice, hyperparameters, and training.

# Ways of deploying a model
